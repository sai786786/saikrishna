  A continuous integration and deployment pipeline (CD/CI) is such an important aspect of a software project.
  It saves a ton of manual, error-prone deployment work. It results in higher quality software for continuous integration,
  automated tests, and code metrics. Ultimately this facilitates better software that can be released more frequently

<p>Building the image in Jenkins

Now that we know our Docker image can be built, we'll want to do it automatically every time there is a change to the application code.

For this, we'll use Jenkins. Jenkins is an automation server often used to build and deploy applications.

Note: this guide assumes you are running Jenkins 2.0 or newer, with the Docker Pipeline plugin and Docker installed.

If you don't have access to a Jenkins installation, refer to https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Installing+Jenkins
